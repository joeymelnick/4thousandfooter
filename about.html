  			<h2>What is this?</h2>
  			<p>The Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) Four Thousand Footer Club was formed in 1957 to introduce hikers to some of the less known sections of the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The creation of "the list" provided a reason for hikers to explore new areas. This app allows you to track these mountains as you climb them.</p>

  			<h2>About us</h2>
  			<p>A hiking and outdoors enthusiast with an awful memory, Joey created this site as a way for folks to keep track of the mountains they've hiked over 4,000 feet. It's gone through many iterations and now uses Angular, SASS, and Rails. Don't hesitate to get in touch if you have questions or comments.</p>
